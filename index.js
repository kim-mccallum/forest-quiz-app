    {question:"Which of the following statements describes the role of forests in global climate?",
    options: ["Forests do not play a significant role in the global carbon cycle.","Trees are a carbon sink and the world’s forests remove an estimated 2.1 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide annually.","Trees are a significant source of greenhouse gas, producing large amounts of carbon dioxide."],
    answer: "Trees are a carbon sink and the world’s forests remove an estimated 2.1 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide annually.",
    displayAnswer: "Trees are a great carbon sink, with the world’s forests removing an estimated 2.1 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide annually – that’s 2.1 billion tonnes! This plays a fundamental role in balancing the world’s carbon cycle and helping to combat climate change.",

   {question:"Which of the following statements describes another important role of forests?",
    options: ["Forests lower the water table significantly, creating wetland habitat.","Forests reduce drought effects by retaining water, preventing run-off and mitigating flood damage.","Forests create natural habitat barriers, preventing the spread of native species."],
    answer: "Forests reduce drought effects by retaining water, preventing run-off and mitigating flood damage.",
    displayAnswer: "Forests can retain excess rainwater, prevent extreme run-offs and reduce the damage of flooding. They can also help mitigate the effects of droughts by releasing water in the dry season, forests can also help provide clean water and mitigate the effects of droughts",
